<!--

## Overview
This lesson introduces students to the concept of creating and assigning variables - numeric variables (including basic math functions / numerical operators) and string variables (including concatenation). There is a small section near the end on different ways to print these variables.

## Important Notes or Prerequisites
- At the point you give this lesson, students are getting their very first introduction to writing code. Don't assume they know anything! Be sure and explain carefully whenever you change even a little thing.
- Encourage students to type, not copy and paste, for practice. Whenever possible, have students try and guess what will happen and try it out in the slide.
- Note: If the code is too long for students to easily see in the embedded slide, there's an "open with repl.it" icon in the top right of the embed that will open the repl.it in a new, larger window.

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Define “variable”.
- Use numerical and mathematical operators.
- Use string variables.
- Print complex variable structures.

## Duration
60 minutes

### Notes on Timing

- A full hour has been allotted for this lesson because it is the first opportunity to let students get into writing code - so make sure to give them plenty of time to poke around in the repls!

### Use the Parking Lot!

- While we have dedicated a whole hour to this lesson, a lot of the content pieces in this lesson are easy segues into other topics. Don't forget about the parking lot mentioned in the Cookbook!

<h2>What's a Variable?</h2>
<p>Turn to the person next to you, and together come up with as many definitions for the word &quot;variable&quot; as you can.</p>

<p>3 MINUTES</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate a “Turn and Talk”:</li>
<li>Ask students to pair up</li>
<li>Each group should brainstorm as many definitions for the word “variable” as they can think of.</li>
<li>They’re not allowed to use dictionaries on their phones or laptops.</li>
<li>Allow 3 minutes for pairs to brainstorm.</li>
<li>Debrief the activity.</li>
<li>Ask a few pairs to share their definitions.</li>
<li>Ask what is common across the different definitions.</li>
<li>Encourage a discussion to see if students can come up with something resembling the idea of variables, or Python saving information for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you noticed, all of these different definitions of variables share one thing in common: they all have something to do with change.</li>
<li>Today, we are going to explore how variables are used in Python.</li>

<h2>Variable</h2>
<p>Variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are boxes that can hold all kinds of information for you.</li>
<li>Make it easier to store and re-use values.</li>
<li>Are the most basic piece of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use a variable, we simply announce that we want to use it (we <strong>declare</strong> it).</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># I&#39;ve eaten 3 cupcakes</span>
cupcakes_ive_eaten <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">3</span>
<span class="bu">print</span>(cupcakes_ive_eaten)
<span class="co"># Prints 3</span></code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring up a repl.it (they haven't seen an interpreter yet!) and run this. It's already written in <a href="https://repl.it/@SuperTernary/python-pt-cupcakes?lite=true">here</a>.</li>
<li>Point out the print statement and comments, as review of the prework.</li>
<li>For variation, assign simple tasks like printing negatives and decimals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While variables can really be anything, we’ll keep it simple to start by looking at numerical variables.</li>
<li>Go over the syntax!</li>
<li>&quot;Here, we create a variable called <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code> and have it hold the number <code>3</code>. This is also called assignment. If we print out the contents of <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code>, Python will tell us that <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code> currently holds 3. When you create a variable, it's called declaring a variable. The syntax for declaring a variable is what you want the variable to be named, followed by an equal sign, and finally what you want the variable to hold. Notice the space before and after the equal sign! Also, note that in Python, the equal sign doesn't evaluate things the way it does in maths. Instead, it assigns them values. Here, we're using the <code>=</code> to tell Python that the <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code> label is going to hold the value <code>3</code>.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;See that underscore? We'll look at variable naming in a second!&quot;</li>
</ul>

<section id="naming-conventions-mistakes-and-syntax" class="level2">
<h2>Naming Conventions: Mistakes and Syntax</h2>
<p>Some common naming mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using meaningful names. <code>delicious = 3</code> doesn't mean anything - <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten = 3</code> does!</li>
<li>Case sensitivity (<code>CUPCAKES_IVE_EATEN</code> and <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code> are not the same!)</li>
<li>No spaces or punctuation (&quot;cupcakes i've eaten&quot; isn't allowed)</li>
<li>This is invalid <strong>syntax</strong></li>
<li>Use snake_case: <code>lowercase_letters_with_underscores</code> (it's in the official <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles">Python style guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring up a replit - <a href="https://repl.it/@SuperTernary/python-pt-cupcakes?lite=true">this one</a> already has the code. As you go through, demo each of these and show it breaking.</li>
<li>Remind the students that if they make a typo, it will create a <em>new</em> variable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;You can name a variable anything you'd like, but you probably shouldn't. If I called my variable &quot;delicious&quot;, would you have any idea that the number it held was the number of cupcakes I've eaten? Probably not. In Python, we try to name variables as closely as we can to what it actually is. Technically, variable names can be almost anything, so it's up to us to be organized and thoughtful when we pick them!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Any name is allowed - Python doesn't enforce helpfulness. Try to always have meaningful variable names so that later, you know what that variable holds!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Variables are case sensitive.</li>
<li><p>&quot;When you want to use a variable name consisting of several words, you will get an error if you have spaces between the words. Try creating a variable called <code>my number</code> and you'll get an error; specifically, one that says &quot;Invalid Syntax.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Syntax is the set of rules surrounding how a language looks. In the English language, we call syntax &quot;grammar.&quot; For example, sentences always start with a capital letter and end with something such as a period, exclamation point, or question mark. Other languages have syntax, too, including programming languages like Python.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Here, Python is telling us that putting a space between two words in a variable name is invalid syntax. It's not proper grammar and it will not run.&quot;</p></li>

<h2>Discussion: Reassigning Variables</h2>

<span class="bu">print</span>(cupcakes_ive_eaten)</code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring up a repl.it and show this. <a href="https://repl.it/@SuperTernary/python-pt-cupcakes?lite=true">Here is one</a> that has this code.</li>
<li>Make it clear that only the last value is saved!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We can always change what a variable is holding; it's just a container. Initially setting a variable to a value is known as assigning the variable. In our example above, we declared the <code>cupcakes_ive_eaten</code> variable and assigned it the value of <code>3</code>.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If we eat more cupcakes, we can <em>reassign</em> the variable to a different value - here, 4.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We can reassign our variable as many times as we want. However, only the most recent value of a variable will be retained. Once a variable is reassigned, its original value is lost forever. If you think of a box, reassigning a variable is like throwing away what's in the box and replacing it with something new.&quot;</li>

<h2>Mathematical Operators</h2>
<p>Math works on numerical variables, too!</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;When we're dealing with variables that have numbers for values, the operators work just like they do with regular math.&quot;</li>
<li>We can use pretty much any mathematical operator in Python to manipulate our variables and achieve our goals with our program. We’ve talked about addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so far.</li>
<li>Note the syntax - the spaces around each character. Note that it works without the spaces, but it's poor practice and harder to read.</li>

<h2>Math On The Same Variable</h2>

<span class="co"># Prints 1.</span></code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;You may have a scenario where you want to reassign a variable to itself. We do this so we don't have to create extra variables. In our cupcakes example, we don't want to have to use a whole new variable just to add a cupcake.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Note that this works because the <em>right</em> side of the equals sign is evaluated first. Thus, the <code>1 + 3</code> in the second line is happening before the reassignment. The right side becomes 4, then that value is set to cupcakes_ive_eaten.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;A great thing about variables is that, because they store a value, you can use them later - even to create new variables. For example, if we have a variable declared <code>cupcakes_in_a_box = 3</code>, and we know that there are 5 cupcakes in a box, we can multiply them to determine the number of cupcakes I will eat. Here's an example:&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>Facilitate a pair programming activity:</li>
<li>Ask students to pair up.</li>
<li>One student (the “driver”) should type the code on the slide into repl.it and run it, making sure it works.</li>
<li><p>Then, working together, the two students should complete the code challenges in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Once students have all finished, show the answer and recap how it works.</p></li>
<li>Whenever possible, have students experiment beyond the prompts on the slide.</li>
<li><p>If students grasp the mathematical operators easily, encourage more difficult exercises in the embedded editor - using more than one variable or combining different math symbols. Give few different example exponents to try, like 5**6 or 10%2. Have them guess the answers before running it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong> - Let’s give it a shot! In a second, I’m going to ask you to pair up and program together in repl.it - In pair programming, one person serves as the driver -- their hands are on the keyboard -- and one person serves as the navigator -- they provide guidance as the code is written. - When you pair up, decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. Then, follow the directions in the comments. - Raise your hand when you’ve managed to complete each step, and I’ll come around and provide feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Repl.it Note:</strong> The code is all comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make a variable to hold the number of guitars you own (3).</p></li>
<li><p>Make a variable to hold the number of guitars Nikhil owns (1).</p></li>
<li><p>You give 2 of your guitars to Nikhil, so subtract 2 from you and add 2 to Nikhil.</p></li>

<h2>Reassignment Shorthand</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress that the shorthand is equivalent to writing out the reassignment in full.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The code on top is good, but it is actually such a common scenario that we want to reassign a variable that we've made a shortcut. For example, saying <code>my_num += 9</code> is exactly the same as saying <code>my_num = my_num + 9</code>. It's just a shorter way to write it.&quot;</p></li>

<li>&quot;For example, five divided by two equals two with a remainder of one. The modulus operator takes two numbers as inputs and returns what is left over from the division.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Apple&quot; is five characters: a, p, p, l, e.</li>
<li>Spaces count! (they're on the keyboard!)</li>

<p>A <em>string</em> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete list of characters.</li>

<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Let's declare some variables in and print them. You'll be doing a lot of programming, and if you practice typing variable declarations out, you'll get faster every time.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>After you run the very last one...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;It's important to note that you cannot do math on strings! Even if what's inside the quotations is a number, Python will interpret it as a word.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Can you predict what the code below will print?&quot; <wait for them to discuss, then run it.></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;In our last example, instead of printing <code>92</code> like you might expect, Python will throw an error. It sees <code>speed</code> as a string, not a number, so it doesn't know how to do addition on it.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Make sure that when you want a numerical value you do not use quotes!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do this with the students! But make sure they do it, too, so they get the typing practice.</li>

<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The <code>+</code> operator means addition for numbers, but not for strings. When given string values, the <code>+</code> operator actually behaves differently — it concatenates, or combines, two strings together to make one big string. Using the <code>+</code> operator to combine the two strings together literally puts them next to each other instead of evaluating their total.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Concatenation is a formal term for when strings are glued together. Here's an example of concatenation.&quot;</p></li>

<h2>We Do: Spaces in Concatenation</h2>
<p>It's another &quot;We Do.&quot; Let's do this together - follow along!</p>
<p>To begin:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">sentence <span class="op">=</span> name <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;is driving his&quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> car <span class="op">+</span> speed</code></pre></div>

</iframe>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do this on the slide, but make sure students follow along.</li>
<li>Explain it as you go. After students see the lack of space, show them adding in the spaces yourself: <code>sentence = name + &quot; is driving his &quot; + car + &quot; &quot; + speed</code>. Then, show commas: <code>print(name, &quot;is driving his&quot;, car, speed)</code></li>
<li>Stress that commas <em>only</em> work for <code>print</code>ing, not for concatenation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python put the strings together, but do you notice anything wrong? There is no space between the words! This is because we didn't add the spaces in. It's just one of many reasons why we have to carefully watch our spacing and grammar!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Since a space is a character - it's on the keyboard - we can make it a string. Therefore, we can add it into our concatenation. By default, concatenation doesn't have spaces - you'll always have to add them yourself.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You can also <code>print</code> directly; you don't necessarily need an extra variable. To print strings next to each other, you separate them with a comma. Then, Python will add the space for you. This isn't concatenating variables, but it's useful to know!&quot; Change code to: <code>sentence = name + &quot; is driving his &quot; + car + &quot; &quot; + speed</code></li>
<li>&quot;When <code>print</code>ing, commas also create spaces.&quot; Change code to: <code>print(name, &quot;is driving his&quot;, car, speed)</code></li>
</ul>
